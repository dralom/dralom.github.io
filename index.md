## Welcome

For the time being this is mostly a placeholder webiste. In the future this may grow into a larger personal presentation website, but it is not that yet.

## Work

Please feel free to browse through the rest of [my github account](https://github.com/dralom) for a sample of my work, though there is very little of it up and public at this time. What there is, is most likely out of support or no longer relevant.

## Contact

If you have reached this page from one of my other social media presences and intend to contact me, please do so through that respective social media or the alternative contact methods listed there, if any.
